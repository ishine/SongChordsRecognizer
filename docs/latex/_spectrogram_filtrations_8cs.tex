\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Interface for all \mbox{\hyperlink{class_song_chords_recognizer_1_1_graphs_1_1_spectrogram}{Spectrogram}} filter functions. Each of Filtration should contain function \textquotesingle{}Filter\textquotesingle{} that returns filtered spectrogram from from misleading informations. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_song_chords_recognizer_1_1_graphs_1_1_filter_nth_harmonics}{Song\+Chords\+Recognizer.\+Graphs.\+Filter\+Nth\+Harmonics}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This algorithm filter spectrogram from nth harmonics which are generated by instruments. That means that if the tone of frequency F is played, then it is also reflected on frequencies \textquotesingle{}F$\ast$n\textquotesingle{} for n = 1,2,3,.... This filtration takes the minimum of spectrogram\mbox{[}i\mbox{]}\mbox{[}j $\ast$ n\mbox{]}$\ast$ (1/epsilon)$^\wedge$\{n-\/1\} for n = 1,2,3,...,n\+\_\+harmonics. By default epsilon=0.\+4 and n\+\_\+harmonics=10. ( \mbox{[}Gomez 2006\mbox{]} Tonal description of polyphonic audio for music content processing. ) \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_song_chords_recognizer_1_1_graphs_1_1_i_spectrogram_filtration}{ISpectrogram\+Filtration}} that doesn\textquotesingle{}t do any of filtration. It will just return spectrogram\+Data. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_song_chords_recognizer_1_1_graphs_1_1_accompaniment_frequency_area_mask}{Song\+Chords\+Recognizer.\+Graphs.\+Accompaniment\+Frequency\+Area\+Mask}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em When we are interested only in the chord recognition, there is only one area of tones that is intendet to accompaniment creation (in other words .. to harmony creation). That area begins cca at the end of the Great octave, and the area ends cca at the middle of the One lined octave. This filtration create a mask for that area, lets the values of that area same. The rest of the frequencies will be set on zero. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_song_chords_recognizer_1_1_graphs_1_1_weighted_octaves}{Song\+Chords\+Recognizer.\+Graphs.\+Weighted\+Octaves}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Basically, we have three (four) types of tones\+: 0) Beats, ect.. 1) Bass 2) Harmony 3) Melody (1) Bass tones are very interesting for chord, because it always specifies the root tone of chord. But sometimes these tones could be misleading, for instance in much more complex basslines like walking bass in Jazz, ect... (2) Harmony is the most interesing area. That area directly represents Chords. (3) Melody is not that interesting for single chords. There could be passages that are not part of our chord. On the other hand, the melody is always based on a harmony. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
